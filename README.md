 this printer is designed to fully print itself and use as many 3d printed parts as possible
 
 the target of this printer is also to reduce cost. But I might change that due to using custom low cost parts would likely require a custom firmware configuration
 
If I used a board like skr-mini-e3-v3 ($50), and a raspberry pi ($40), it doubles the cost of the printer but means it can be much more extensible.

maximize self printed parts
 
I want to use a 120mm3 build volume but might have to go lower due to the flex/warp of parts
